# Hyperspectral-Image-Classification
Hyperspectral Image Classification (HSI) uses deep learning (CNNs, Bi-LSTM) to analyze rich spectral data from hyperspectral sensors. Unlike multispectral images, HSI captures subtle differences across hundreds of bands, improving land cover classification. It's useful in agriculture, urban planning, and environmental monitoring.
